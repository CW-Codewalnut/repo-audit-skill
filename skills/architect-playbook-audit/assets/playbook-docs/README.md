# Architect Playbook

A self-contained, self-improving collection of Claude Code slash-command skills for auditing any codebase. Walk onto a project, install the skills, run multiple audits in parallel from separate chat sessions with `--worktree`, fix what they find, review the fixes in a Git worktree, and let `/system-self-improve` patch the audits themselves whenever a review surfaces a gap.

## Audit types

- **Start:** **[Pre-Audit Setup](pre-audit-setup/SKILL.md)** — map the repo before judging it.
- **Ship:** **[Quality Gates](quality-gates-audit/SKILL.md)** — pre-hooks and release QA · **[Bundle and Build Health](bundle-build-audit/SKILL.md)** — build output and artifacts.
- **Risk:** **[Security](security-audit/SKILL.md)** — app and browser security · **[Dependency Health](dependency-audit/SKILL.md)** — package and lockfile risk.
- **Experience:** **[Accessibility](accessibility-audit/SKILL.md)** — WCAG and usability · **[Performance](performance-audit/SKILL.md)** — speed and rendering cost · **[Error Handling](error-handling-audit/SKILL.md)** — failure states and recovery.
- **Code:** **[Architecture](architecture-audit/SKILL.md)** — boundaries and coupling · **[Testing](testing-audit/SKILL.md)** — behavior coverage · **[React](react-audit/SKILL.md)** — components and hooks · **[TypeScript](typescript-audit/SKILL.md)** — type safety · **[Linting](linting-audit/SKILL.md)** — rule coverage.
- **Knowledge:** **[Documentation](documentation-audit/SKILL.md)** — docs and drift · **[Agentic Setup](agentic-audit/SKILL.md)** — agent instructions and safety rails.

## Core principles

- **Opinionated baselines.** Each audit grades against a specific opinionated baseline, not whatever happens to be in the codebase.
- **Static-first with optional enrichment.** Every audit is read-only by default. Runtime or network data is opt-in via explicit `--with-*` flags.
- **Two-phase flow.** Every audit reports findings, then asks whether to generate an implementation plan. Mutation is never automatic.
- **Boundary discipline.** Cross-cutting concerns are explicitly called out.
- **Self-improving.** When a review surfaces a gap, `/system-self-improve` patches the originating audit.

## The workflow

1. **Get the playbook and install the skills.**
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repository> ~/architect-playbook
   cd ~/architect-playbook
   claude       # open this directory in Claude Code
   ```
   Then, in the Claude Code chat:
   ```
   /install-architect-playbook-globally
   ```
   That's it. Every audit slash command is now available in every Claude Code session on the machine. The clone ships with `.claude/skills/install-architect-playbook-globally` already committed so this one bootstrap command is available the moment you open the cloned repo — no manual copy step needed.

   *(Optional, for teams: once you `cd` into a target project, you can also run `/install-architect-playbook-locally` to pin the skills alongside that project in version control. Most users don't need this.)*

2. **Prepare the project.**
   ```
   /pre-audit-setup
   ```

3. **Run audits.**
   ```
   /security-audit              # concise Top 5 recommendations + full report saved to disk
   /security-audit --worktree   # run in an isolated worktree (recommended for parallel audits)
   ```
   Open multiple chats and add `--worktree` in each for true parallel execution.

4. **Fix the findings** in the same chat that produced them.

5. **Re-run the audit** to review the fix (best done in a fresh chat or worktree).

6. **Evolve the playbook** if a gap is found:
   ```
   /system-self-improve
   ```

## Flags

Every audit supports the same minimal set:

```
/<skill-name>                    # default: concise Top 5 + full report saved + ask about plan
/<skill-name> --worktree         # create an isolated Git worktree, then run the audit there
/<skill-name> --learn            # engineer teaching mode
/<skill-name> --teach            # alias for --learn
```

Some audits expose additional enrichment or threshold flags (`--with-*`, `--threshold-*`). See the individual `SKILL.md` for details.

**Pro tip**: Add `--worktree` to any audit to run it in an isolated Git worktree.

## The findings-file contract

Audits, fixes, and reviews each run in different chat sessions, so they cannot share in-memory state. The protocol between them is a deterministic on-disk shape:

```
.architect-audits/
  <audit-name>/
    findings.md       human-readable report you can read at a glance
    findings.json     machine-readable list of issues for downstream skills
    snapshot.md       the Layer 0 diagnostic snapshot, on its own
    metadata.json     skill version, run timestamp, graphify revision hash
```

- **Chat output** is human-first and concise: a short header, the Top 5 Highest-Leverage Recommendations (title, why it matters, consequences, smallest fix, lettered sub-actions), and a one-line pointer to the full report on disk. The full layered findings are never printed in the chat unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Fixing** is a free-form chat conversation in the same chat that produced the audit.
- **Reviewing** is re-running the originating audit in a fresh chat against the worktree containing the fix.
- **`/system-self-improve`** reads a review's gap report and proposes an edit to the originating audit's `SKILL.md`.

Current dogfood reports for this repository are committed under `.architect-audits/` for pre-audit setup, quality gates, testing, and architecture. Each report includes `findings.md`, `findings.json`, `snapshot.md`, and `metadata.json` so downstream sessions can consume the same contract they expect from target projects.

## How audits grade issues

The full detailed report saved to `.architect-audits/<audit-name>/findings.md` grades every check with one of four statuses:

- **present** — the expected invariant is fully satisfied.
- **partial** — mostly correct, but with noticeable gaps or inconsistencies.
- **missing** — a required foundation (tooling, pattern, or configuration) is absent.
- **violation** — concrete code actively breaks the invariant.

The concise Top 5 recommendations you see by default in chat focus on **missing** and **violation** items (the highest-impact issues), plus the most important **partial** findings. The full report on disk shows the complete status for every check.

`/system-self-improve` uses a different outcome model (`advanced | blocked | skipped`).

## The full skill list

### Setup utilities

| Trigger | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`/install-architect-playbook-locally`](install-architect-playbook-locally/SKILL.md) | Copy every playbook skill into the current project's `.claude/skills/`. |

### Audits

Every audit also accepts the universal `--worktree`, `--learn`, and `--teach` flags. `--worktree` creates an isolated Git worktree before running the audit; `--learn` and `--teach` enable engineer teaching mode. The "Additional flags" column lists per-audit enrichment flags on top of those. Per-audit `--threshold-*` flags also exist as escape hatches and are documented in each `SKILL.md`.

| Trigger | Purpose | Additional flags | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`/quality-gates-audit`](quality-gates-audit/SKILL.md) | Pre-commit, pre-push, and CI/CD lifecycle gates. | — | Static-only audit; no enrichment flags. |
| [`/security-audit`](security-audit/SKILL.md) | Frontend security: auth, XSS, headers, secrets. | `--with-scan` | Enrich the static report with findings from installed security scanners (`eslint-plugin-security`, `eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized`, `eslint-plugin-react-security`). |

## Conventions

- **Conventional Commits** for every commit.
- **No abbreviations** in skill names, triggers, descriptions, headings, identifiers, or prose.
- **Read-only by default.** Mutating runs require an explicit `--apply` flag and print a dry-run summary first.
- **Frontmatter shape** is fixed: `name`, `description`, `trigger`. The `trigger` value equals `/<folder-name>`.
- **No hard-coded absolute paths** in skill bodies. Derive from the current working directory or `$HOME`.

The full set of project-wide rules lives in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide. The short version:

- **Add a new skill:** create a folder named after the slash command (full words, no abbreviations), write a `SKILL.md` following the canonical body structure, add the table row and the per-skill summary in the same commit. Audits also get the worktree Pro Tip block.
- **Improve an existing skill:** prefer the self-improvement loop. Run the audit, fix the findings, review the fix in a worktree, then run `/system-self-improve` so the patch to the audit body is grounded in a real gap rather than speculation.
- **Run the repository gates:** `python3 scripts/validate-playbook.py` before every pull request. For local commit and push hooks, run `python3 scripts/install-git-hooks.py` once per clone.

The architectural intent behind the playbook's conventions lives in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Foundational decisions are recorded as ADRs in [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/).
